# Using GIS to address climate change
An ArcGIS StoryMap that highlights my GIS work on studying and addressing climate change, designed to share my findings and spark further dialogue.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS StoryMaps, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Instant Apps, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, ArcGIS Survey123, ArcGIS Network Analyst

I first downloaded the files and went on ArcGIS StoryMaps to create a new story. From there I added the basic elements down such as adding a title, a captivating short introduction, and an roadmap for great flow in the StoryMap setting the stage for the outline in the contents shown in the StoryMap for an effective and captivating story. The Sidecar was created and the first slide on Visualizing climate change data, I typed down subheading taking about things like weather variables that led to the creation of climate models that can be combined with GIS to plan for future impacts of climate change. It explains the example which is also shown on the right hand side of the screen detailing the ArcGIS Instant Apps Rondonia Land Cover Change from 1992 to 2020.

I created the second slide which talks about Mitigating greenhouse gases. It talks about spatial data being the key to mitaging greenhouse gases using location and data to integrate, analyze, and understand data in new visual ways which can be used both on local and global levels. It talks about vehicular sources and the importantance of optimizing vehicular routes to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions with the example of the right side of the screen from ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Navigator. I create the third slide talking about electricity sources drawing attention to switching to clean energy sources like solar energy since there is a lot of solar radiation that is high in a lot of places that has untapped potential. An example from ArcGIS Pro is actively showing buildings that have solar radiation over the course of the year, naturally with temperatures in the summer being the highest. Shades of blue show lower energy potential while shades of yellow, orange, and red show higher energy potential.

The fourth slide talks about Understanding exposure to climate-related hazards. Climate related hazards/disasters such as flooding, drought, and extreme heat are an effect of climate change. These worsening conditions should drive us prepare how these hazards will affect our communities now and in the future. The 3D Miami Beach Sea Level Rise created on ArcGIS Pro is an example on the right side of the screen shows a 3D visualization of infrastructure being affected by sea level rise, which can in turn support local planners and decision makers. The fifth slide talks about 

## Lessons Learned:


It's akin to Powerpoint slides
The improtantance of crafting a captivating story to improve change and action

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
